FuzzySearch
===========
Search through your models while tolerating slight mis-spellings. If you have a Person in your database named O'Reilly, you want your users to be able to find it even if they type "OReilly" or "O'Rielly".

Installation
============
NOTE! The following plugin is a prerequisite:
  script/plugin install git://github.com/blythedunham/eload-select.git
More details at http://www.snowgiraffe.com/tech/329/eager-loading-select-plugin-when-select-plays-nice-with-include/

Example
=======

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  include FuzzySearch
  fuzzy_search_attributes :name, :surname
  # ...
end

people = Person.fuzzy_find "OReilly"

# Fuzzy find works on scopes too. This includes named_scopes.
people = Person.scoped({:conditions => ["state='active'"]}).fuzzy_find("OReilly")


If you define a methods returning a string

  def self.normalize(word)

before include the FuzzySearch than this method gets used to normlize any word. default is to downcase the string (which does only work properly within ascii)

Trigrams table
==============

For each model that you want to fuzzy-search, you have to define a Trigram model and table, using the following example:

  create_table "person_trigrams", :force => true do |t|
    t.integer "person_id"
    t.string  "token",   :null => false
  end

  # The PersonTrigram model itself
  class PersonTrigram < ActiveRecord::Base
  end
